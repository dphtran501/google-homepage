A reconstruction of the Google.com homepage.

The purpose of this project is to practice the basics of HTML and CSS. In addition, the project helps me familiarize myself with Git and the browser's developer tools (e.g. Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools), specifically using the developer tools to edit CSS on the fly and for analyzing the CSS files of the actual Google.com homepage.
