A [reconstruction](https://dphtran501.github.io/google-homepage/) of the Google.com homepage.

The purpose of this project is to practice the basics of HTML and CSS, and to become familiar with Git and the browser's developer tools (e.g. Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools). The focus of the basics was the positioning and alignment of elements. The browser developer tools were used to debug and edit CSS on the fly and for analyzing the CSS files of the actual Google.com homepage.
